3. NSE stock data is downloaded and loaded into the dataframe using pandas.
4.Data cleaning and formating is done.
5.The necessary parameters such as closing price against time are plotted using matplotlib.
6.The dataset is the converted into array using Numpy.
7.The data is scaled using MinMax scaling to avoid overshadowing.
